# Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) - National Centre For Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) - Genomics Unit

NCFAD provides scientific and laboratory services for the rapid and accurate identification and reporting of emerging and transboundary diseases with the only containment level (CL) 4 animal health lab in Canada co-located with Public Health Agency of Canadaâ€™s CL4 laboratory at the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health.

The NCFAD Genomics Unit is lead by [Dr. Oliver Lung](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=oliver+lung) and operates a unique CL 3 High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Facility (lab certification in Summer 2017).

This GitHub organization contains open-source tools and pipelines developed by the bioinformaticians and software developers at the NCFAD that routinely used for analysis of viral and metagenomic Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data.

Although NCFAD primarily deals with pathogenic animal or zoonotic viruses such as [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3/), [FMDV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=12110), [CSFV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=11096), [ASFV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=10497) and [avian influenza virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Database/nph-select.cgi?go=database), we have experience working with bacterial, 16S and RNASeq data as well.
