# Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) - National Centre For Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) - Genomics Unit

NCFAD provides scientific and laboratory services for the rapid and accurate identification and reporting of emerging and transboundary diseases with the only containment level (CL) 4 animal health lab in Canada co-located with Public Health Agency of Canada’s CL4 laboratory.

The NCFAD Genomics Unit is lead by [Dr. Oliver Lung](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=oliver+lung) and operates Canada’s only CL 3 High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Facility (lab certification in Summer 2017).

This GitHub organization contains open-source tools and pipelines developed by the bioinformaticians and software developers at the NCFAD that routinely used for analysis of viral and metagenomic Illumina, Nanopore and Ion Torrent HTS data.

Although NCFAD primarily deals with pathogenic animal or zoonotic viruses such as [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3/), [FMDV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=12110), [CSFV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=11096), [ASFV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=10497) and [avian influenza virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Database/nph-select.cgi?go=database), we have experience working with bacterial, 16S and RNASeq data as well.
